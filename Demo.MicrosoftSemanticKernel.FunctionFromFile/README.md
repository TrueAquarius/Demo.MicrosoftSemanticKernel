- Azure OpenAI Service 

## Configuration
- Set the following environment variables:
  - `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`: The endpoint for the Azure OpenAI service.
  - `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`: The API key for the Azure OpenAI service.

## Notes

- At the time when this demo was created, the Semantic Kernel framework seemed to still undergo a lot of changes. Therefore these code examples may not work in future releases of that framework.
- Microsoft Semantic Kernel version 1.49.0 was used for this demo.
